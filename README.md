Train a CNN to identify dog breeds
## Project Overview

The project is the part of the Udacity Nano degree program, this is the capstone project meant to show what you have learned through out the course of this nano degree.
This project is an early attempt at larning the true potential of AI using CNN.
The problem statement is: build an algorithm so that given a picture the model can identify whether it's a dog or a human or neither. If it's a dog, what is it's breed, if it's a human than what breed of dog he/she most resembles.

Data:
Train, validation and test data was provided as part of this project. There are 6680 training images, 835 validation images and 836 test images.

Metrics used to check the robustness of the model is the accuracy on the test data, so the model with the best accuracy will be selected.
